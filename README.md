# django and GraphQl(Graphene)

GraphQL is a query language and server-side runtime for application programming interfaces (APIs) that prioritizes giving clients exactly the data they request and no more. 

GraphQL is designed to make APIs fast, flexible, and developer-friendly. It can even be deployed within an integrated development environment (IDE) known as GraphiQL. As an alternative to REST, GraphQL lets developers construct requests that pull data from multiple data sources in a single API call. 

Additionally, GraphQL gives API maintainers the flexibility to add or deprecate fields without impacting existing queries. Developers can build APIs with whatever methods they prefer, and the GraphQL specification will ensure they function in predictable ways to clients.

I Developed a Simple Django Application Using graphene To Make Some simple Apis And Secure Them with JWT Using (Django GraphQL JWT). Also I Used a Third-party Library(django-graphene-permissions) To Check Permissions But i didnt Use Complex Permissions.Just Made Simple Permissions To Show How They Works.
